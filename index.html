  <h1>Welcome to 5S Training!</h1>

  <p>**5S** is a methodology for organizing and improving your workplace for efficiency and effectiveness. It stands for five Japanese terms that translate to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>**Sort (Seiri)**: Eliminate unnecessary items from the workplace.</li>
    <li>**Set in Order (Seiton)**: Arrange necessary items in a designated place for easy retrieval.</li>
    <li>**Shine (Seiso)**: Clean and inspect the workplace to identify and address issues.</li>
    <li>**Standardize (Seiketsu)**: Create visual standards for maintaining the organized workplace.</li>
    <li>**Sustain (Shitsuke)**: Continuously practice and improve 5S principles.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting Started:</h2>

  <p>
    * **Assemble your team:** 5S is most effective when implemented by a team. Discuss the goals and benefits of 5S with your team members.
    * **Gather your supplies:** Depending on your workspace, you may need supplies like trash bags, labels, bins, and cleaning materials.
  </p>
